Revision history for CPAN-Mini-Inject

0.23 - Sat Oct 25 09:54:45 2008
	Rebundled to remove OS X extended attributes that were causing tests to fail.

0.22    06/25/2008
        - fixed a bug where authors were being added
          more than once to 01mailrc.txt.gz

0.21    06/25/2008
        - changes for RT bug 17386 by: David Bartle

0.20    06/25/2008
        - added a command line option '--all-in-meta' which will
          parse the META.yml and index every module listed in the
          'provides' section
        - module name and version is now parsed correctly from the 
          filename if relative or absolute paths are specified
        - changes for RT bug 37093 by: David Bartle

0.18.1  06/25/2008
        - Fixed bug number 28363
          http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28363

0.18    04/02/2005
        - Fixed bug number 11718 involving the Line-Count in 
          02packages.details.txt.gz not being updated.
        - Added tests for update_mirror method.
        - Migrated tests to HTTP::Server::Simple.

0.16    01/08/2005
        - Decreased the size of t/read/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz reducing
          greatly the size of the package.
        - More problems discovered with exception testing. Moved all
          exception tests to a single zz.exceptions.t, skip them all
          if Test::Exception isn't installed.

0.14    01/05/2005
        - Added an optional filename parameter to parsecfg. This allows
          calling parsecfg without having to previously call loadcfg
          (tests added as required).
        - Updated Synopsis to not using method chaining, but documented
          that it is possible.
        - Updated prereq of CPAN::Mini to version 0.32
        - Fixed a warning message if dirmode isn't configured during the
          inject process.
        - Fixed update_mirror to call CPAN::Mini->update_mirror directly
          fixing a problem with CPAN::Mini::Inject and the latest version
          of CPAN::Mini (0.32).

0.12    01/04/2005
        - Tests failed for inject and add on Windows systems. These tests
          have now been skipped.
        - Reverted all tests to use eval{}. Using eval "" caused problems
          on Windows, while eval{} only caused problems on one AIX box.

0.10    12/30/2004
        - Fixed dirmode in inject(), add(), writelist(), so that all files
          created are set with the correct permissions.
        - Added tests for directory and file modes.

0.08    12/08/2004
        - Tests were found to fail on AIX which contained eval{}, all
          tests updated with eval "".
        - Added a default value for dirmode in update_mirror based on
          umask.
        - Added a dirmode option to the config file.
        - Fixed regex in mcpani to allow for developer version numbers
          with add (ie. CPAN-Mini-Inject-0.07_001).
        - Add a prereq for CPAN::Mini version 0.24. This version contains
          a bugfix to properly handle dirmode. (Thanks RJBS).

0.06    11/10/2004

        - mcpani now parses the file passed to it to determine module name
          and version. Command line options override the parsing.
        - loadcfg() croaks if no configuration file is found.

0.04    11/05/2004

        - t/readlist.t and t/writelist.t both skip failure tests if
          the uid is 0.
        - inject accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode which
          lists modules as they are injected.
        - testremote accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode 
          which display the site being tested, and which is selected.
        - Added --passive switch to mcpani to enable passive ftp
        - Minor updates to perldoc in mcpani
        - Added CPAN::Mini as a required module to Makefile.PL

0.02    10/31/2004
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
