Revision history for CPAN-Mini-Inject

0.30    2011/06/13
        - keep just the last added module, even if there was one in
          02packages.details.txt before we injected
          (Paul Driver <frodwith@cpan.org>)
        - documentation fix (Randy Stauner <rwstauner@cpan.org>)

0.29    2011/05/15
        - Skip tests that are unreliable under a DNS regime where any
          hostname resolves.
        - RT 63350 - Anchor the regex to filter old modules
        - RT 55463 - Don't use .bak for test files
        - RT 63407 - Win32 fixes related to file locks in tests
        - Changed tests so they'll be able to deal with read-only dist files

0.27    2010/01/28
        All the following are thanks to Jozef Kutej <jozef@kutej.net>:

        - --discover-packages option added to parse .pm files inside
          --file and extract package names andV versions.

        - allow CHECKSUMS signing.

        - keep just last added module version in 02packages.details.txt.

0.26    2009/06/15
        - Specify minimum File::Path version

0.25    2009/05/29
        - Move to GitHub

0.24    2009/05/10
        - Made tests use a port (11027) other than 8080 to avoid clashes
          with existing services.

0.23    2008/10/25
        - Rebundled to remove OS X extended attributes that were causing
          tests to fail.

0.22    2008/06/25
        - fixed a bug where authors were being added
          more than once to 01mailrc.txt.gz

0.21    2008/06/25
        - changes for RT bug 17386 by: David Bartle

0.20    2008/06/25
        - added a command line option '--all-in-meta' which will
          parse the META.yml and index every module listed in the
          'provides' section
        - module name and version is now parsed correctly from the 
          filename if relative or absolute paths are specified
        - changes for RT bug 37093 by: David Bartle

0.18.1  2008/06/25
        - Fixed bug number 28363
          http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28363

0.18    2005/04/02
        - Fixed bug number 11718 involving the Line-Count in 
          02packages.details.txt.gz not being updated.
        - Added tests for update_mirror method.
        - Migrated tests to HTTP::Server::Simple.

0.16    2005/01/08
        - Decreased the size of t/read/authors/01mailrc.txt.gz reducing
          greatly the size of the package.
        - More problems discovered with exception testing. Moved all
          exception tests to a single zz.exceptions.t, skip them all
          if Test::Exception isn't installed.

0.14    2005/01/05
        - Added an optional filename parameter to parsecfg. This allows
          calling parsecfg without having to previously call loadcfg
          (tests added as required).
        - Updated Synopsis to not using method chaining, but documented
          that it is possible.
        - Updated prereq of CPAN::Mini to version 0.32
        - Fixed a warning message if dirmode isn't configured during the
          inject process.
        - Fixed update_mirror to call CPAN::Mini->update_mirror directly
          fixing a problem with CPAN::Mini::Inject and the latest version
          of CPAN::Mini (0.32).

0.12    2005/01/04
        - Tests failed for inject and add on Windows systems. These tests
          have now been skipped.
        - Reverted all tests to use eval{}. Using eval "" caused problems
          on Windows, while eval{} only caused problems on one AIX box.

0.10    2004/12/30
        - Fixed dirmode in inject(), add(), writelist(), so that all files
          created are set with the correct permissions.
        - Added tests for directory and file modes.

0.08    2004/12/08
        - Tests were found to fail on AIX which contained eval{}, all
          tests updated with eval "".
        - Added a default value for dirmode in update_mirror based on
          umask.
        - Added a dirmode option to the config file.
        - Fixed regex in mcpani to allow for developer version numbers
          with add (ie. CPAN-Mini-Inject-0.07_001).
        - Add a prereq for CPAN::Mini version 0.24. This version contains
          a bugfix to properly handle dirmode. (Thanks RJBS).

0.06    2004/11/10

        - mcpani now parses the file passed to it to determine module name
          and version. Command line options override the parsing.
        - loadcfg() croaks if no configuration file is found.

0.04    2004/11/05

        - t/readlist.t and t/writelist.t both skip failure tests if
          the uid is 0.
        - inject accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode which
          lists modules as they are injected.
        - testremote accepts a true parameter to enable verbose mode 
          which display the site being tested, and which is selected.
        - Added --passive switch to mcpani to enable passive ftp
        - Minor updates to perldoc in mcpani
        - Added CPAN::Mini as a required module to Makefile.PL

0.02    2004/10/31
        - First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
