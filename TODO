- Add logging to a file all the updates that are occuring (verbose mode
  to a file).

- Add a method to remove packages from the repository

- Add testing for verbose modes (check STDOUT to make sure the output is
correct).

- Think about adding a simple HTTP::Server::Simple to serve CPAN.

- Add plugins via Module::Pluggable if it's available

- Migrate mirroring functions from CPAN::Mini into CPAN::Mini::Inject removing the requirement for CPAN::Mini.
